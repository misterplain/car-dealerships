Estimated time needed: 9-11 hours

A national car dealership with local branches spread across the United States recently conducted a market survey. One of the suggestions that emerged from the survey was that customers would find it beneficial if they could access a central database of dealership reviews across the country.

You are a new hire at the company. You are assigned the task of building a website that allows new and existing customers to look up different branches by state and look at customer reviews of the various branches. Customers should be able to create an account and add their review for any of the branches. The management hopes this will bring transparency to the system and also increase the trust customers have in the dealership.

After thorough research and brainstorming, the team developed use cases for anonymous, authorized, and admin users.

Use cases for anonymous users:
View the Contact Us page.
View the About Us page.
View the list of dealerships.
Filter the list of dealerships by state:
Select Show all or a specific state from the State dropdown on the dealership page.
View all states if nothing is selected in the dropdown.
View a table of dealerships for the selected state when the form is submitted.
Click on a dealership to view the reviews for that dealership on the details page with each review displayed on a bootstrap card.
Log in using their credentials.
Use cases for authorized users:
In addition to the above, authorized users should be able to write a review for any dealership on the dealership's page. In order to enable authorized users to write their reviews:

A Review button should be provided against each dealer listed in the dealership table.
Clicking on the Review button should take the user to the review page.
Filling the form on the review page and submitting it should add the review.

Solution architecture
The solution will consist of multiple technologies

The user interacts with the "Dealerships Website", a Django website, through a web browser.

The Django application provides the following microservices for the end user:

get_cars/ - To get the list of cars from
get_dealers/ - To get the list of dealers
get_dealers/:state - To get dealers by state
dealer/:id - To get dealer by id
review/dealer/:id - To get reviews specific to a dealer
add_review/ - To post review about a dealer
The Django application uses SQLite database to store the Car Make and the Car Model data.

The "Dealerships and Reviews Service" is an Express Mongo service running in a Docker container. It provides the following services::

/fetchDealers - To fetch the dealers
/fetchDealer/:id - To fetch the dealer by id
fetchReviews - To fetch all the reviews
fetchReview/dealer/:id - To fetch reviews for a dealer by id
/insertReview - To insert a review
"Dealerships Website" interacts with the "Dealership and Reviews Service" through the "Django Proxy Service" contained within the Django Application.

The "Sentiment Analyzer Service" is deployed on IBM Cloud Code Engine, it provides the following service:

/analyze/:text - To analyze the sentiment of the text passed. It returns positive, negative or neutral.
The "Dealerships Website" consumes the "Sentiment Analyzer Service" to analyze the sentiments of the reviews through the Django Proxy contained within the Django application.
